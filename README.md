Sequence detector '01000'
# Question:
  Design a Moore FSM circuit that detects the sequence ‘01000’ using tinkercad

Inference:

i. Types of Flip-Flops used:

a. 2 Dual D Flip-Flops (i.e. 3 Flip-Flops)

ii. Number of Logic Gates Used – 4

a. 3-input AND gate
  
b. AND gate
  
c. OR gate
  
d. NOT gate

iii. Number of clock cycles required to get the output – 5

iv. Sample sequence – 01000

Conclusion:
      
  In this project we implemented Moore FSM sequence detector which detects the sequence ‘01000’ is passed at the input. When the sequence ‘01000’ is detected, the yellow LED turns ON. In other cases, the LED remains in OFF state.
